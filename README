textobj-indblock
----------------

This plugin provides text objects to act on a block of indentation whitespace
based on the indentation of the current line.

This plugin supplements, and in this respect closely follows the example of
Kana Natsuno's textobj-indent plugin:

https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-indent

In general, that plugin is more useful but in some occasions it can be
preferable to act on indentation whitespace directly.

Installation
------------

Move the files into their respective directories inside your ~/.vim directory
(or your $HOME\vimfiles directory if you're on Windows).

With a plugin manager such as pathogen the installation is as simple as:

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/glts/vim-textobj-indblock.git textobj-indblock

Finally, don't forget to run ":helptags" or equivalent on your doc directory
to register the help file.
